🎮 AI Configuration Challenge
Master Prompt Engineering & Multi-Agent Systems

Configure AI agents to generate perfect code • Maximum Score: 120 points • Be the AI whisperer! 🚀
🎯 Your Mission: Master AI Configuration to Generate Perfect Code

🎮 This is an AI Configuration Game! Instead of writing code yourself, you'll become an AI prompt engineer and system architect. Your goal is to configure AI agents (models, prompts, temperatures, cycles) to automatically generate code that scores the maximum 120 points.

🏆 The Challenge:

    🤖 Configure AI agents - Choose models, craft prompts, set temperatures
    🔧 Engineer the system - Set cycles, agent specialization, and orchestration
    📊 Optimize for scoring - Use the grader feedback to improve your configuration
    🎯 Achieve perfection - Get your AI to generate 120/120 point solutions consistently

🔬 What makes this challenging:

    Different models have different strengths
    Prompt engineering requires precision and creativity
    Temperature affects consistency vs creativity
    Multi-agent coordination needs careful orchestration
    Context length limits force strategic choices

🐛 The Coding Challenge Your AI Must Solve

Function to implement: calculate_user_metrics(users, start_date, end_date)

What your AI must figure out:

    Filter users by date range and activity status
    Calculate engagement scores with proper formula
    Handle all edge cases (empty inputs, missing keys, zero division)
    Return top 5 performers sorted correctly
    Provide accurate statistics

🧠 Your AI needs to discover:

    The exact engagement formula: (posts * 2 + comments * 1.5 + likes * 0.1) / days_active
    How to handle days_active = 0 without crashing
    String date comparison logic for filtering
    Proper error handling for missing dictionary keys
    Efficient sorting and top-N selection

👆 The Game: Go to 'Configure AI & Generate' to build your AI system, then see the 'Prompt Inspector' to understand exactly what your models receive!
🎯 Optimization Targets

🐛 Critical Bugs (65 pts):

    ❌ Division by zero when days_active = 0
    ❌ Missing dictionary keys
    ❌ Wrong calculation logic
    ❌ Incorrect averaging (all vs active users)

🔧 Logic Issues (28 pts):

    ❌ Wrong sorting direction
    ❌ No active users in date range
    ❌ Input data mutation

🎯 Edge Cases (17 pts):

    ❌ Less than 5 users available
    ❌ Invalid date ranges
    ❌ Malformed data handling

⚡ Performance (10 pts):

    ❌ Inefficient algorithms
    ❌ Unnecessary operations

🏅 AI Configuration Strategy

🤖 Model Selection:

    🧠 llama-3.3-70b: Best overall reasoning
    ⚡ llama3.1-8b: Fast, good for focused tasks
    🎯 llama-4-scout-17b: Strong at analysis
    🔍 qwen-3-32b: Good at edge case detection

🌡️ Temperature Tuning:

    0.0-0.2: Deterministic, consistent output
    0.3-0.5: Balanced creativity/consistency
    0.6-1.0: Creative but potentially inconsistent

🔄 Multi-Agent Tactics:

    Specialization: Bug finder, edge case handler, optimizer
    Progressive refinement: Multiple cycles for improvement
    Context management: Balance depth vs token limits

📝 Prompt Engineering:

    Specificity: Mention exact issues to address
    Examples: Reference the scoring criteria
    Structure: Clear instructions and expectations
